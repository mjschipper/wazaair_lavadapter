# wazaair_lavadapter
**This is an adapter for the Waza Air to insert a set of Lavalier microphones between the cushion and speaker.**

- I initally created the WAZA_Headphone_Spacer.scad file using OpenSCAD to get the correct shape and alignment of the magnet and locator holes.
- After getting a correct fit i started using Blender to add a Lavalier Microphone clip to hold the mics. Then exported to STL for printing.

**WIP:**
-   Test Magnet hold for both sides of insert.
-   I need to mirror a copy of one insert to allow for a left/right pair.
-   Test comfort of having two inserts.

If you find a way to improve the design or have conducted any experiments for sound and/or usability please feed them back to me and we can work together to create a great solution to a common downside to the Waza Airs.

Obviously this project is still a work in progress so please keep that in mind. I wont take any responsibilities for damage, etc if you use this.
