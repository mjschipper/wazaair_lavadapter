# wazaair_lavadapter
This is an adapter for the Waza Air to insert a set of Lavalier microphones between the cushion and speaker.

I initally created the WAZA_Headphone_Spacer.scad file using OpenCAD to get the correct shape and alignment of the magnet and locator holes.
After getting a correct fit i started using Blender to add a Lavalier Microphone clip to hold the mics. Then exported to STL for printing.

TBC:
  I need to mirror a copy of one insert to allow for a left/right pair.
  Test comfort of having two inserts.
