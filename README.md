# wazaair_lavadapter
**This is an adapter for the Waza Air to insert a set of Lavalier microphones between the cushion and speaker.**

- I initally created the WAZA_Headphone_Spacer.scad file using OpenCAD to get the correct shape and alignment of the magnet and locator holes.
- After getting a correct fit i started using Blender to add a Lavalier Microphone clip to hold the mics. Then exported to STL for printing.

**WIP:**
-   I need to mirror a copy of one insert to allow for a left/right pair.
-   Test comfort of having two inserts.
